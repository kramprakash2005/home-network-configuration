Creating an home network and configure it with both wired and wireless connection 

As part of my ongoing coursework in the Networking Basics course at Cisco Networking Academy, I recently completed a project where I configured and simulated a home network setup. The network is configured on a home connection template using Cisco Packet Tracer and integrates both wired and wireless connections for seamless internet access across different devices. 

After configuring the network, I conducted manual testing by using the ping command to check the connectivity between different devices. I tested PC-to-PC connections via the wired network and also pinged from a PC to the wireless laptop. This helped verify network reachability and stability across both wired and wireless connections.

Here's an overview of the setup:

1)Internet Source: 
The network connects to the internet via a cable modem, distributing the connection through both wired and wireless means.

2)Home Wireless Router: 
This router is the central hub, providing wireless internet access to mobile devices like laptops and smart TVs.

3)Wired Devices:
Office PC: Hardwired to the router for maximum stability and speed, ideal for bandwidth-intensive tasks.
Bedroom PC: Another wired PC located in the bedroom for smooth and uninterrupted connectivity.

4)Wireless Devices:
Laptop: Wirelessly connected, offering flexibility of use around the house.

5)Server for Testing: I added a server to test the connection across the internet, simulating real-world scenarios to ensure external services could be accessed and monitored effectively.

This project showcases my understanding of fundamental networking principles and my ability to configure and test reliable home networks, as part of my learning journey with Cisco Networking Academy.
